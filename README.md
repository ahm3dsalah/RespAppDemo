# RestpAppDemo

sample of using spring boot to handle transaction managment using rest services

 - for transaction summary I used Async function to handle the calulation whenever a new transaction add to the list
 - the result will be cached using spring caching for fast retreival 
 - also custom error handling is used to handle transaction adding error
